As a new father I found myself confused and overwhelmed in the many details needed to keep the family running. Going out with the baby? Better don't forget to bring the food. Fixing the evening-chores? Everything must be ready for tomorrow's ensuing chaos. Going to the gym? No more forgetting to bring keys or shoes using Checklist Templates.

What I needed was checklists, that could be rapidly reused. I didn't find what I needed, so I built this app, and rely heavily on it for my daily survival.

I hope it will be useful for others as well!

### FIXME for release

- [ ] Prevent un-favoriting when updating a template
