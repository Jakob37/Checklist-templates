I have frequently found myself wanting to reuse a specific checklist multiple times. Perhaps with smaller alterations, such as depending on what weather it is.

This app attempts to solve this, in as minimalist fashion as possible. The idea is to pre-define lists of tasks in "checklist templates", which then can be easily be reused at any time.
